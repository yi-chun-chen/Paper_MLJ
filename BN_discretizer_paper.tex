Bayesian networks \citep{Pearl_1988, PGM_2009} are an increasingly popular method for modeling uncertainty and causality in science and engineering.
They provide an efficient factorization of the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables.
Bayesian networks first emerged from artificial intelligence research and have been applied to a wide variety of problems, ranging from decision-making systems \citep{DMU_2015} \mykel{better to use a primary source} to medical diagnoses \citep{Lustgarten_2011}.
In most cases, we assume that all random variables in Bayesian networks are discrete, since many Bayesian network learning algorithms are unable to deal with continuous variables efficiently.

They provide an efficient factorization of the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables.
Bayesian networks first emerged from artificial intelligence research and have been applied to a wide variety of problems, ranging from decision-making systems \citep{DMU_2015} to medical diagnoses \citep{Lustgarten_2011}.
\mykel{packages such as ....}
In most cases, we assume that all random variables in Bayesian networks are discrete, since many Bayesian network learning algorithms are unable to deal with continuous variables efficiently.
However, many applications require the use of continuous variables, such as position and velocity in dynamic systems \citep{kochenderfer2010airspace}.

There are three common approaches to extending Bayesian networks to continuous variables.
The first is to model the conditional probability density of each continuous variable using specific families of parametric distributions, and then to redesign Bayesian network learning algorithms based on their parameters.
One successful example are Gaussian graphical models \citep{Weiss_2011}.
For other parametric distributions and non-linear functions \citep{Ihler_2009}, these redesigned algorithms are computationally expensive and do not perform well.
The second is to use nonparametric distributions, such as particle representations and Gaussian processes \todo{[cite]}.
\todo{These have the advantage of BLAH BLAH, and their parameter set grows lineary with the amount of data.}

The third approach is discretization.
Automated discretization methods have been studied in machine learning and statistics for many years \citep{Dougherty_1995, Kerber_1992, Holte_1993, Fayyad_1993}, primarily for classification problems.
They search for the best discretization policy of a continuous attribute by considering its interation with the target class variable.
Interations and dependencies between variables in Bayesian networks are more complicated, where discretization requires considering the impact on the variable's Markov blanket.
Prior work exists for discretizing continuous variables in naive Bayesian networks and tree-augmented networks \citep{Fried_naive}, but only a few discretization methods for general Bayesian networks have been proposed \citep{Friedman_1996, Kozlov_1997, Monti_1998, Steck_2007}.


This work is primarily concerned with the minimum description length (MDL) principle discretization \citep{Friedman_1996} and MODL discretization \citep{Boulle_2006} methods.
The former is the predominant discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks, and is compared to our proposed Bayesian method in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.
The latter is a Bayesian discretization method for one continuous variable against a discrete target class, which our proposed method generalizes to Bayesian networks.
The asymptotical equivalence between MDL and MODL was examined in \citep{VL_2000}.

The MDL principle was first proposed by \cite{MDL_1978} and states that the best model for a dataset is one that minimizes the amount of information needed to describe it \citep{Grunwald_2009}.
MDL methods trade off goodness-of-fit against model complexity to reduce generalization error.
In the context of Bayesian networks, \cite{Friedman_1996} applied the MDL principle to determine the optimal number of discretization intervals for continuous variables and the optimal positions of their discretization edges.
Their approach selects a discretization policy that minimizes the sum of the description lengths of the discretized Bayesian network and the information necessary for recovering the continuous values from the discretized data.
\todo{Results in this work suggest that the MDL method suffers from....}

The optimal discretization policy is found with dynamic programming.
For Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables, MDL discretization is iteratively applied to each continuous variables.
While iterating, only one variable is treated as continuous while all other continuous variables are treated as discretized based on an initial discretization policy or the discretization result from a previous iteration.

The network structure is not always known in advance.
Bayesian network structure learning can be extended to distributions including continuous variables by alternating between traditional discrete structure learning and optimal discretization.
Starting with some preliminary discretization policy, one applys a structure learning algorithm to identify the locally optimal graph structure.
The discretization policy is refined based on the learned network.
The cycle is continued until convergence.

MODL discretization \citep{Boulle_2006} is a Bayesian method for discretizing a continuous feature according to a class variable.
Bayesian methods maximize the probability of the model given the data, $P(\textit{Model} \mid \textit{Data})$.
An application of Bayes' rule and constant $P(\textit{Data})$ shows that this is equivalent to maximizing

\begin{align}
P(\textit{Model}) \cdot P(\textit{Data} \mid \textit{Model})\text{,}
\end{align}

\noindent
where $P(\textit{Model})$ is a prior over models and ${P(\textit{Data} \mid \textit{Model})}$ is the data likelihood.
The data likelihood usually increases with the number of discretization intervals, as more intervals allow for richer representations.
The prior is chosen to decrease as the number of discretization intervals increases to favor simpler models and prevent overfitting.
Maximizing ${P(\textit{Model}) \cdot P(\textit{Data} \mid \textit{Model})}$ requires a trade-off when determining the number of discretization intervals.

The MODL method uses dynamic programming to find the optimal discretization policy, and has an $\bigo\paren{N^3 + r \cdot N^2}$ runtime, where $N$ is the of number of data instances and $r$ is the number of instances for the class variable.
\cite{Lustgarten_2011} suggest several formulations for the prior term $P(\text{Model})$.
Under a uniform prior probability over discretizations the runtime can be reduced to $\bigo\paren{r \cdot N^2}$ without sacrificing optimality.

This paper describes a new Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks, extending prior work on single-variable discretization methods from \citet{Boulle_2006} and \citet{Lustgarten_2011}.
The proposed method optimizes the discretization policy relative to the network and takes parents, children, and spouse variables into account.
The optimal single-variable discretization method is derived in Section \ref{sec:single_var}, and a second heuristic method is proposed which reduces the runtime from exponential to polynomial.
Section \ref{sec:multi_var} covers Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables and discretization while simultaneously learning network structure.
The paper concludes with a comparison against the existing minimum-description length \citep{Friedman_1996} method on real-world datasets in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
This section covers the notation used throughout the paper and provides a brief overview of Bayesian networks, including the factorization of joint probability distributions, sampling from a Bayesian network, and structure learning.
These concepts will be used in later sections.
The formal definition of a discretization policy for a continuous variable is also given.

\subsection{Bayesian Networks and Sampling}

A Bayesian network $B$ is defined by a pair $(G,\bm{\theta})$, where $G$ is a directed acyclic graph whose $n$ nodes $X_{1:n}$ are random variables.
The edges in a Bayesian network represent probabilistic dependencies among nodes and encode the Markov property: each node $X_i$ is independent of its non-descendants given its parents $\Pa_{X_i}$ in $G$.
For a Bayesian network over discrete and discretized variables, $r_i$ represents the number of instantiations of $X_i$, and $q_i$ represents the number of instantiations of the parents of $X_i$.
If $X_i$ has no parents, then $q_i = 1$.
The $j$th instantiation of the parents of $X_i$ is denoted $\bm{\pi}_{ij}$.

The conditional relations are parameterized by the elements of $\bm{\theta}$, written $\theta_{ij}^{(k)}$, which determines

\begin{equation}
P(X_i = k \mid \bm{\pi}_{ij}) = \theta_{ij}^{(k)}\text{.}
\end{equation}

The joint distribution over the variables in the Bayesian network factors according to the Markov property:

\begin{equation}
P(X_{1:n}) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i \mid \Pa_{X_i})\text{.}
\end{equation}

Forward sampling is often used to draw samples from the joint distribution represented by a Bayesian network.
Variables are sampled in topological order such that parental instantiations are always known~\citep{algo_2009}.
Furthermore, the parent $\rightarrow$ child sampling order can be reversed if the marginal probability of the child variable is known.
% By Bayes' rule,

% \begin{equation}
% P(X_i \mid \Pa_{X_i}) \cdot \prod_{Y \in \Pa_{X_i}} P(Y) = P(X_i) \cdot P(\Pa_{X_i} \mid X_i)\text{.}
% \end{equation}

\subsection{Structure Learning}

It is often necessary to infer the structure of a Bayesian network from data.
Three common approaches to Bayesian network structure learning are constraint-based, score-based, and Bayesian model averaging \citep[see][chap.~18]{PGM_2009}.
This work uses the K2 structure learning algorithm \citep{K2}, one of the most successful score-based structure learning methods.
Score-based structure learning methods over discrete variables commonly evaluate candidate structures according to their likelihood against a dataset $D$.
Let $m_{ij}^{(k)}$ be the number of times $X_i = k$ given $\bm{\pi}_{ij}$ in $D$.
The likelihood is given by

\begin{equation}
P(D\mid \bm{\theta}, G) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^{q_i} \prod_{k=1}^{r_i} \brock{\theta_{ij}^{(k)}}^{m_{ij}^{(k)}}\text{.}
\end{equation}


Structure search for a Bayesian network seeks the graph structure $G$ that maximizes ${P(G\mid D)}$.
In practice one maximizes the log-likelihood, also known as the Bayesian score~\cite{cooper1992bayesian}:

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BayesianScore}
  \ln P(D\mid G) = \ln P(G) + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^{q_i} \ln\paren{
    \frac{
      \Gamma\paren{\alpha_{ij}^{(0)}}
    }{
      \Gamma\paren{\alpha_{ij}^{(0)} + m_{ij}^{(0)}}
    }
  } + \sum_{k=1}^{r_i} \ln\paren{
    \frac{
      \Gamma\paren{\alpha_{ij}^{(k)} + m_{ij}^{(k)}}
    }{
      \Gamma\paren{\alpha_{ij}^{(k)}}
    }
  }\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{small}

In the equation above,

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{ij}^{(0)} = \sum_{k=1}^{r_i} \alpha_{ij}^{(k)} \quad \qquad m_{ij}^{(0)} = \sum_{k=1}^{r_i} m_{ij}^{(k)}\text{.}
\end{equation}

The space of acyclic graphcs is superexponential in the number of nodes so it is common to rely on heuristic search strategies \citep{PGM_2009}.
The K2 algorithm assumes a topological ordering of variables and greedily adds parents to nodes to maximally increase the Bayesian score.
A fixed ordering ensures acyclicity but does not guarantee a globally optimal network structure.
K2 is typically run multiple times with random variable orderings and the network with the highest likelihood is retained.

\subsection{Discretization Policies}

Let $\cX$ be a continuous variable and let $\cx$ be a specific instance of $\cX$.
A discretization policy $\Lambda_{\cX} = \curly{e_1 < e_2 < \ldots < e_{k-1}}$ for $\cX$ is a mapping from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\curly{1,2,3,\ldots,k}$ such that

\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_{\cX}(\cx) = \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $x<e_1$}\\
    i, & \text{if $e_{i-1} \leq x < e_i$}\\
    k, & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The discretization policy discretizes $\cX$ into $k$ intervals.
Let the samples of $\cX$ in a given dataset $D$ be sorted in ascending order, ${\cx_{1:n} = \curly{\cx_1 \leq \cx_2 \leq \ldots \leq \cx_n}}$, and let the unique values be ${\cu_{1:n} = \curly{\cu_1 \leq \cu_2 \leq \ldots \leq \cu_n}}$.
The index of the last occurence of $\cu_i$ in $\cx$ is denoted $s_i$.

The discretization edges $e_{1:k-1}$ mark the boundaries between discretization intervals.
In this work they are restricted to the midpoints between unique ascending instances of $\cX$.
Thus, each edge $e_i = \paren{\cu_{s_{j+1}} - \cu_{s_j}}/2$ for some $s_j$.
An integer representation of $\Lambda_{\cX}$ can thus be written $\Lambda_{\cX} = \curly{\lambda_1 < \lambda_2  < \ldots < \lambda_k}$, where $\lambda_1 = s_1$ and $\lambda_i \in s_{1:|\cu|}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Single Variable Discretization}
\label{sec:single_var}

This section covers the discretization of a single continuous variable $\cX$ in a Bayesian network where all other variables are discrete.
Let $n_p$ and $n_c$ respectively refer to the number of parents and number of children of $X$.
Each child $C_i$ of $X$ may possess other parents, referred to as spouses of $X$.
The set of spouses of $X$ is denoted $\boldsymbol{S_i}$.

Let $D$ be a dataset of $N$ samples from which the discretization will be learned, sorted in ascending order according to $X$.
Let $D_{\boldsymbol{Y}}$ will refer to the data instances associated with variables $\boldsymbol{Y}$, thus $D_X = \{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_N \}$.
In order to facilitate understanding, we temporarily assume all values in $D_X$ are unique, that is, $x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_N$.
It follows that a discretization policy $M$ on $X$ can be written as $M_X = \brock{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k}$, where $k$, $n_1$, $n_2$, $\ldots,n_k$ are positive integers satisfying $N = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i$.
\mykel{$\bigstar$ This conflicts with Section 3.2, right?}
An optimal discretization policy maximizes $P(M)\cdot P(D\mid M)$ for some prior $P(M)$ and likelihood $P(D\mid M)$.

%Furthermore, since there might have repeated values for $D_x$, we assume there are $N'$ unique values of $D_x$ and $N' \leq N$. Note that the allowable discretization edges happens between two consective values of non-repeated value of $D_x$. For example, if $D_X = \{ 1.0,1.0,2.0\}$, then the only possible discretization edge is on $1.5$.


\subsection{Priors and Objective Function}

The following four principles for the optimal discretization policy, motivated by MODL, enable the formulation of $P(M)$ and $P(D \mid M)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A discretization edge located at $(x_i + x_{i+1})/2$ has probability
\begin{equation}
1 - {\exp(- L \cdot {{x_{i+1} - x_i}\over{x_N - x_1}})},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the largest cardinality number of discrete variables in $X$'s Markov blanket. \tim{Where does this come from? Is there an intuitive explanation?}\mykel{$\bigstar$}
\item For a given interval of $M$, every distribution of $\Pi_X$ is equiprobable.
\item For each pair of $(C_i,\boldsymbol{S_i})$ and a given interval of $M$, every distribution of $C_i$ with a value of $\boldsymbol{S_i}$ is equiprobable.\mykel{$\bigstar$}
\item The distributions of each $C_i$ and $\Pi_X$ in each interval of $M$ with each value of $\boldsymbol{S_i}$ are independent from each other.\mykel{$\bigstar$}
\end{enumerate}

From the first principle one obtains
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:p_M}
  P(M) = \prod_{i=1}^k \curly{ \brock{1 - {\exp(- L \cdot {{x_{s_i+1} - x_{s_i}}\over{x_N - x_1}})}} \cdot \exp\paren{L \cdot {{x_{s_{i}} - x_{s_{i-1} + 1}}\over{x_N - x_1}}}},
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $s_i = \sum_{j=1}^k n_j$ and $s_k = N$, $s_0 = 0$.
The Bayesian network graph structure causes the likelihood term $P(D \mid M)$ to factorizes according to $X$'s Markov blanket:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:p_D_given_M}
  P\paren{D \mid M} \propto P\paren{D_{\Pi_x} \mid M} \cdot \prod_{i = 1}^{n_c} P\paren{D_{C_i} \mid M, D_{\boldsymbol{S_i}}}\text{.}
\end{equation}

For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:example_factorization}, the corresponding $P(D \mid M)$ is factorized according to
\begin{equation}
P\paren{D_{ P_1,P_2,P_3 } \mid M} \cdot P\paren{ D_{ C_1 } \mid M,D_{\boldsymbol{S_1}}} \cdot P\paren{D_{C_2} \mid M,D_{ S_2  }}\text{.}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
  \label{fig:example_factorization}
  %\begin{tabular}{cc}
    \input{graph1}
  %\end{tabular}
  \caption{Factorization of $P(D \mid M)$}
\end{figure}

The concept behind the factorization also the motivation behind forward sampling in a Bayesian network.
The parents of $X$ are independent of the children given $X$.
The parents are not necessarily individually independent, and thus the parental term $P(D_{\Pi_x} \mid M)$ cannot be factored further.
The children of $X$ are similarly independent given $X$ and its spouses $\boldsymbol{S_i}$, leading to their factored product $\prod_{i = 1}^{n_c} P(D_{C_i} \mid M, D_{\boldsymbol{S_i}})$.
Each component in the decomposition be evaluated based on a discretization policy $M = [n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k]$ and dataset $D$.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of $P(D_{\Pi_x} \mid M)$}
Let $J_P = \prod_{i=1}^{n_p} \| P_i \|$. It follows that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:likelihood_one}
P(D_{\Pi_X} \mid M) = \prod_{i=1}^k  {{1}\over{{n_i + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P -1}}}
{{1}\over{ {{{n}_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p)}_{i,1} !} {n^{(p)}_{i,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p)}_{i,J_P} !}}  }}\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $n^{(p)}_{i,j}$ is the number of instances in the $i$th discretized interval with the $j$th value of $\Pi_X$.
Note that $n_i = \sum_{j=1}^{\| \Pi_x \|} n^{(p)}_{i,j}$.
The two factors on the right hand side comes from the second prior: all distributions of values of $\Pi_X$ in a given interval are equiprobable. According to the fourth prior, the distribution in each interval is independent, so the two factors are multiplied together.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of $P(D_{C_i} \mid M, D_{\boldsymbol{S_i}})$}
For each pair $(C_j, \boldsymbol{S_j})$, let $\|C_j \| = J_j$ and $\| \boldsymbol{S_j} \| = L_j = \prod_{v \in \boldsymbol{S_j}} \| v \|$. It follows that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:likelihood_two}
P(D_{C_j}  \mid M, D_{S_j}) =
\prod_{i=1}^{k} \prod_{l=1}^{L_j} {{1}\over{{n_{i,l} + J_j - 1}\choose{J_j-1}}}
{{1}\over{ {{n_{i,l}}!}\over{ {n^{(j)}_{i,1,l} !} {n^{(j)}_{i,2,l} !} \cdots {n^{(j)}_{i,J_j,l} !}}  }}\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $n^{(j)}_{i,m,l}$ is the number of instances in $i$th interval with $m$th value of $C_j$ and $l$th value of $\boldsymbol{S_j}$, $n_{i,l} = \sum_{m=1}^{J_j} n^{(j)}_{i,m,l}$, and $n_i = \sum_{l=1}^{L_j} n_{i,l}$.
The two factors on the right hand side come from the third prior: all distribution of values of $C_j$ in a given interval and with a given value of $S_j$ are equiprobable. According to the forth prior, these distributions are independent from each other, and one thus takes their product. If $S_j = \emptyset$, then Equation~\ref{eq:likelihood_two} is equivalent to

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:likelihood_three}
P(D_{C_j}  \mid M) =
\prod_{i=1}^{k}  {{1}\over{{n_{i} + J_j - 1}\choose{J_j-1}}}
{{1}\over{ {{n_{i}}!}\over{ {n^{(j)}_{i,1,\emptyset} !} {n^{(j)}_{i,2,\emptyset} !} \cdots {n^{(j)}_{i,J_j,\emptyset} !}}  }}\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $n^{(j)}_{i,m,\emptyset}$ is the number of instances in the $i$th interval with the $m$th value of $C_j$, and $\sum_{m=1}^{J_j} n^{(j)}_{i,m,\emptyset} = n_i$.

The objective function can be formulated given equations \ref{eq:p_M}, \ref{eq:p_D_given_M}, \ref{eq:likelihood_one}, and \ref{eq:likelihood_three}.
The log-inverse of $P(M) \cdot P(D|M)$ is minimized for computational convenience:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:opt_prob}
\begin{aligned}
& \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} - \log(1 - {\exp(- L \cdot {{x_{s_i+1} - x_{s_i}}\over{x_N - x_1}})}) +  \sum_{i=1}^{k} L \cdot {{x_{s_{i}} - x_{s_{i-1} + 1}}\over{x_N - x_1}} +\\
&  \sum_{j=1}^{n_c} \sum_{i=1}^{k}  \sum_{l=1}^{L_j} \left[  \log{{n_{i,l} + J_j - 1}\choose{J_j-1}} + \log \left( { {{n_{i,l}}!}\over{ {n^{(j)}_{i,1,l} !} {n^{(j)}_{i,2,l} !} \cdots {n^{(j)}_{i,J_j,l} !}} } \right) \right] + \\
& \sum_{i=1}^k \left[  \log {{n_{i} + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P-1}} + \log \left( { {{n_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p)}_{i,1} !} {n^{(p)}_{i,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p)}_{i,J_p} !}} } \right) \right]\text{.}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

All parameters and variables in the objective function are explained in previous subsections.

\subsection{Algorithm}

This section describes the procedure used to minimize the objective function.
Note that the objective function is cumulative over intervals, thus, if a partition of $X$ into $k$ intervals with lengths $n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k$ is an optimal discretization policy, then any subinterval is optimal for the corresponding subproblem.
It follows that dynamic programming can be used to solve the optimization problem exactly.

Every midpoint between two nonequal consecutive values in $D_X$ is a candidate discretization edge.
Let ${D'_X} = \brock{x'_1,x'_2,\ldots,x'_M}$ be the set of unique values of $D_X$ sorted in ascending order, where $M$ is the number unique values in $D_X$.
Recall that $D_X$ is also sorted.
Let $b = \brock{b_0,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_M}$ be an increasing sequence of integers marking the repeated value intervals in $D_X$ such that $b_0 = 0$ and $x_{b_{i-1} + 1} = x_{b_{i-1} + 2} = \ldots = x_{b_i} = x'_i$.
By this definition, the allowable discretization positions are $d_i = \paren{x_{b_{i}} + x_{{b_i}+1}}/2$ for all \todo{$i = 1,2,\ldots,M-1$}.

Precomutation reduces runtime.
Compute $h(u,v)$ for each interval $I_q$ starting from $x_{u}$ to $x_{v}$ for all $(u,v)$ satisfying $u \leq v$:

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
h(u,v) &=  \log {{n_{q} + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P-1}} + \log \left( { {{n_q}!}\over{ {n^{(p)}_{q,1} !} {n^{(p)}_{q,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p)}_{q,J_p} !}} } \right) \\
& + \sum_{j=1}^{n_c} \sum_{l=1}^{L_j} \left[  \log{{n_{q,l} + J_j - 1}\choose{J_j-1}} + \log \left( { {{n_{q,l}}!}\over{ {n^{(j)}_{q,1,l} !} {n^{(j)}_{q,2,l} !} \cdots {n^{(j)}_{q,J_j,l} !}} } \right) \right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{small}

The evaluation of $h(u,v)$ for all $u \leq v$ is summarized in Algorithm \ref{alg:h} in the appendix.
The calculation has a $O(n_c  {v'_\text{max}} \cdot N^2 + {v'_\text{max}}^{n_p} \cdot N^2)$ runtime, where $n_c$ and $n_p$ are the numbers of child and parent variables respectively, and $v'_\text{max}$ is the largest cardinality of variables that directly connect to $X$. \tim{so parents and children, or parents, children and spouses?}

The optimization problem over Equation~\ref{eq:opt_prob} can now be solved.
The dynamic programming procedure is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:disc_one}.
It takes two inputs: $D$, the joint samples over all variables sorted in ascending order according to $D_X$, and $G$, the network structure.
The runtime of Algorithm~\ref{alg:disc_one} is also $O(n_c  {v'_\text{max}} \cdot N^2 + {v'_\text{max}}^{n_p} \cdot N^2)$, because the runtime of the dynamic programming procedure is less than the runtime for computing $h(u,v)$.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:disc_one} is guaranteed to be optimal.
For faster methods with suboptimal results please refer to \citep{Boulle_2006}.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Approximation}

Algorithm \ref{alg:disc_one} has an exponential $\bigo\paren{\paren{v'_\text{max}}^{n_p} \cdot N^2}$ runtime which severely limits discretization in networks with a large number of discretization intervals or parent variables.
This section introduces an approximation to the objective function that significantly reduces the runtime and still preserves the quality of discretization.
The approximation replaces the dominator of the last factor in Equation~\ref{eq:likelihood_one} with

\begin{equation}
{\frac{{n_i}!}{ {n^{(p)}_{i,1} !} {n^{(p)}_{i,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p)}_{i,J_P} !}}} \approx \prod_{r=1}^{n_p} { {{{n}_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p_r)}_{i,1} !} {n^{(p_r)}_{i,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p_r)}_{i,J_{p_r}} !}}}\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $J_{p_r} = \| P_r\|$ and ${n^{(p_r)}_{i,j} !}$ is the number of instances in the $i$th interval with the $j$th value of $P_r$.
The approximated objective function is

\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:opt_prob_approx}
& \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} - \log(1 - {\exp(- L \cdot {{x_{s_i+1} - x_{s_i}}\over{x_N - x_1}})}) +  \sum_{i=1}^{k} L \cdot {{x_{s_{i}} - x_{s_{i-1} + 1}}\over{x_N - x_1}} +\\
&  \sum_{j=1}^{n_c} \sum_{i=1}^{k}  \sum_{l=1}^{L_j} \left[  \log{{n_{i,l} + J_j - 1}\choose{J_j-1}} + \log \left( { {{n_{i,l}}!}\over{ {n^{(j)}_{i,1,l} !} {n^{(j)}_{i,2,l} !} \cdots {n^{(j)}_{i,J_j,l} !}} } \right) \right] + \\
& \sum_{i=1}^k \left[  \log {{n_{i} + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P-1}} + \sum_{q=1}^{n_p} \log \left( { {{{n}_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p_q)}_{i,1} !} {n^{(p_q)}_{i,2} !} \cdots {n^{(p_q)}_{i,J_{p_q}} !}}} \right) \right]\text{.}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{small}

The approximation reduces the runtime of Algorithm~\ref{alg:disc_one} to a polynomial, $\bigo\paren{ {v'_\text{max}} \cdot (n_c + n_p) \cdot N^2}$.
It will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:experiments} that the approximation is more sensitive to the distribution over other variables and is biased towards slightly higher interval counts.
\tim{We need to have a more specific thing to say along the lines of When does it fail?}

With the approximated objective function, Equation~\ref{eq:opt_prob_approx}, provides intuition into how child and parent variables contribute to the objective function.
For example, in the left graph of Figure~\ref{fig:example_networks}, the corresponding square brackets in the approximated objective function are

\begin{small}
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \label{eq:example_approx}
   \sum_{i=1}^k & \left\lbrace   \left[ \log{{n_{i} + J_{C_1} - 1}\choose{J_{C_1}-1}} + \log \left(  {{{n_i}!} \over { {n^{(1)}_{i,1,\emptyset} !} \cdots {n^{(1)}_{i,J_{C_1},\emptyset} !}} }  \right)  +  \right. \right.\\
  & \left.  \log{{n_{i} + J_{C_2} - 1}\choose{J_{C_2}-1}} + \log \left(  {{{n_i}!} \over { {n^{(2)}_{i,1,\emptyset} !} \cdots {n^{(2)}_{i,J_{C_1},\emptyset} !}} }  \right)  \right] + \\
  &  \left. \left[  \log {{n_{i} + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P-1}} +  \log \left( { {{{n}_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p_1)}_{i,1} !}\cdots {n^{(p_1)}_{i,J_{p_1}} !}}} \right) +{ {{{n}_i}!}\over{ {n^{(p_2}_{i,1} !}\cdots {n^{(p_2)}_{i,J_{p_2}} !}}}  \right] \right\rbrace \text{.}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{small}

In Equation~\ref{eq:example_approx}, each child carries two terms, as shown in the first set of square brackets, but the two parent variables only carry a total of three terms, as shown in the second set of square brackets.
In this case the child variables have greater effect than the parent variables even though the number of child and parent variables are the same.
However, if $C_2$ has an additional parent $S_2$, as shown in the right graph of Figure~\ref{fig:example_networks}, the importances of $C_2$ will be reduced, because the information from $C_2$ is now affected by $S_2$.
This argument shows that the proposed method, both before and after approximation, indeed incorporates graph structure when discretizing continuous variables.

\section{Multiple Variable Discretization}
\label{sec:multi_var}

\subsection{Discretization of Multiple Continuous Variables}

The single-variable discretization method can be extended to Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables by iteratively discretizing variables individually.
The discretization process for a single variable requires that all other variables be discrete.
The iterative approach thus requires a prediscretization policy from which to initialize the process.
This work uses prediscretization with equal-width intervals, defined by

\begin{equation}
M_X = \curly{X_\text{min}, X_\text{min} + \delta, X_\text{min} + 2\delta, \ldots, X_\text{max}}\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $X_\text{min}$ and $X_\text{max}$ are the extrema values of $D_X$, $\delta = (X_\text{max} - X_\text{min})/k$, and $k$ is the desired number of intervals.
This work sets $k$ to the median value of the cardinalities of initially discrete variables in the network.
After prediscretization, the one-variable discretization methis is iteratively applied over each continuous variable in reverse topoligical order, from the leaves to the root.
Let one such series of discretizations be a cycle.
Reverse topological order has the advantage of using less prediscretized instantiations during the first cycle.
For example, in the right-hand graph of Figure \ref{fig:example_networks}, assume $S_2$ is the only discrete variable.
The discretization of $P_1$ involves both $P_2$ and $X$, whereas the discretization of $C_1$ only involves $X$.

The algorithm is terminated when the number of discretization intervals and their associated edges converge for all variables.
A maximum cycle count is enforced to prevent infinite iterations when convergence does not occur.
The algorithm typically converges within a few cycles when tested on real-world data.
In cases where it does not converge, ten cycles usually produce decent discretization results.

The pseudocode for the multi-variable discretization procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:disc_two}.
It requires four inputs: $D''$, the joint samples from all network variables; $G$, the network structure; $C$, the set of all continuous variables in a reverse topological order; and $u_{cycle}$, the upper bound of times of cycles.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Discretization of multiple continuous variables \todo{Fix label reference number}}
  \label{alg:disc_two}
  \begin{algorithmic}[5]
  \Function{Discretize}{$D''$, $G$, $C$, $u_{cycle}$}
    \State
    \State $M[i] \leftarrow$ the discretization policy for the $i$th variable
    \State $n \leftarrow$ the number of variables in the Bayesian network
    \State $D^*_i \leftarrow M[i] (D_i)$, list of samples $D_i$ discretized according to $M[i]$
    \State $D^* \leftarrow $ the discretized data for all variables, where $D^*_i \leftarrow D''_i$ if $i \notin C$
    \State $k \leftarrow median\{ |v|, v\notin C\}$
    \State
    \For {$i = 1$ to $n$}
      \If {$i \in C$}
        \State $M[i] \leftarrow$  equal-width discretization with $k$ intervals
        \State $D^*_i \leftarrow  M[i] (D''_i)$
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \State
    \State $cycle \leftarrow 0$
    \While {$M$ is not converged  \textbf{and} $cycle \leq u_{cycle}$}
      \State {$cycle  \leftarrow cycle  + 1$}
      \For {$j = 1$ to $|C|$}
        \State $D^*_{\backslash C(j)} \leftarrow D^*$ without $D^*_{C(j)}$.
        \State {$M[C(j)] \leftarrow $ DISCRETIZE($D_{C(j)}$,$D^*_{ \backslash C(j)}$,graph)}
        \State {$D^*_{C(j)}  \leftarrow$ $M[C(j)](D''_{C(j)})$}
      \EndFor
    \EndWhile
    \State \Return $M$
  \EndFunction
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Combining Discretization with Structure Learning}

In many situations the network structure is not known in advance and must be learned from data.
Traditional Bayesian structure learning algorithms require discretized data, whereas the proposed discretization algorithm requires a network structure.
This section combines the proposed discretization method with the K2 structure learning algorithm \citep{K2} in an interative fassion to simultaneously perform Bayesian structure learning and discretization of continuous variables.

The proposed algorithm alternates between K2 structure learning and discretization.
K2 is run on the discretized dataset corresponding to prediscretizations for all continuous variables.
The affected continuous variables are rediscretized every time an edge is added by K2.
The resulting discretization policies are used to update the discretized dataset, and the next step of the K2 algorithm is executed.
This cycle is repeated until the K2 algorithm reaches a local maximum.

This procedure is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure_learn}.
It takes five inputs: $D'$, the joint samples from all network variables; $C$, the set of all continuous variables; $order$, the permutation of variable for $K2$; $u_{parent}$, the upper bound on the number of parents per node for $K2$; and $u_{cycle}$, the upper bound on the cycle count.
It is common practice to run K2 multiple times with different permutations of the variables and to then choose the structure with the highest score.
This work runs Algorithm \ref{alg:structure_learn} multiple times, each with a different order, and picks the discretized Bayesian network with the highest score.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

This section describes experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed methods.
All experiments were run on datasets from the publically available Irvine machine learning repository \citep{Lichman_2013}.
Variables are labelled alphabetically in the order given on the dataset information webpage.
Subscripts inducate the number of discretized intervals.
Shaded nodes are originally discrete and unshaded nodes are originally continuous.

For each dataset, the experiment consists of two parts.
In the first part, the Bayesian network structure is known in advance, which is obtained by equal-width prediscretization and the K2 algorithm.
In the second part, the Bayesian netowrk structure is not provided in advance, and it is learned during the discretization process.

The discretizations are compared using the mean cross validated log-likelihood of the data set $D$ given the resulting graph structure $G$ and discretization policy set $\discset$.
The log-likelihood contains two components,

\begin{equation}
\ln p(D\mid G, \discset) = \ln P(D^*\mid G) + \ln p(D\mid \discset, D^*)\text{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $D$ is the original dataset and $D^*$ is the dataset discretized according to $\discset$.
The log-likelihood of the discretized dataset is the Bayesian score (Equation ~\ref{eq:BayesianScore}) evaluated with a uniform prior.
The log-likelihood of the original dataset given the discrete dataset is

\begin{equation}
  \ln p(D\mid \discset, D^*) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^{q_i} \sum_{k=1}^{r_i} m_{ijk} \ln\paren{
    \frac{
      1
    }{
      \discset^{(ij)}_{k+1} - \discset^{(ij)}_{k}
    }
  }\text{.}
\end{equation}

The proposed Bayesian discretization method is compared against MDL.
For a Bayesian network with a single continuous variable $X$, the MDL objective function is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:MDL}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} \log(N) \left\lbrace  \lvert \Pi_{X_i} \rvert (\lvert X^*_i \rvert - 1) +
 {\sum_{j,X_i \in \Pi_{X_i}}} \lvert \Pi_{X^*_j} \rvert (\lvert X_j \rvert - 1) \right\rbrace + \log(\lvert {X^*_i} \rvert) \\
 + (N_i-1) H \left( {{|X^*_i| - 1}\over{N_i -1}}  \right) -N \cdot \left[ I(X^*_i,\Pi_{X_i}) + {\sum_{j,X_i \in \Pi_{X_i}}} I(X_j, \Pi_{X^*_j}) \right]\text{,}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $I(A,B)$ is the mutual information between the discrete variables $A$ and $B$, ${H(p) = -p \log(p) - (1-p) \log(1-p)}$ \tim{does $H(p)$ have a name? Entropy?}, and \todo{$X^*_i$ is the discretized version of the $i$th sample of $X$}.
The optimal discretization policy is found with dynamic programming in a similar manner as with the Bayesian method.


\subsection{Auto MPG Dataset}
\label{subsec:auto}

In this subsection, two experiments are conducted on the Auto MPG dataset from the Irvine repository \citep{Lichman_2013}. The dataset has \num{392} instances after deleting the six instances with missing data, and eight variables. Three variables are discrete: $B$, $G$, and $H$ with cardinality \num{5}, \num{13}, and \num{3} respectively. Two expiriments are conducted, one with a given network structure and one in which the structure is learned.

\subsubsection{Discretization with fixed Structure}
\label{subsubsec:auto_exp1}

The optimal Bayesian approach and the MDL discretization method are tested on Auto MPG data given the network network in Fig. \ref{fig:auto_graph_1}. This structure was obtained by prediscretizing each continuous variable into five uniform-width intervals, where five is the median cardinality of the discrete variables, and then taking the most frequent structure from a thousand runs of K2. \yichun{most frequent?}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
   \input{graph_autocar_1}
   \caption{Structure from prediscretized K2 structure learning to compare the methods for Auto MPG dataset}
  \label{fig:auto_graph_1}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{table:auto_disc_table_1} shows the positions of discretization edges, and log-likelihood of 10-fold cross validation by three discretization methods. For the Bayesian network in Fig. \ref{fig:auto_graph_1}, the approximation \ref{eq:opt_prob_approx} only reduces runtime and has no influence on discretization result. MDL principle discretization works not well, since it discretizes each continuous variable by only one interval. The reason that the MDL method discretizes variables into too few number of intervals is discussed in Section \ref{subsec:discuss_exp}.

The color of discretized area shows the probability of a sample being in the discretized area. The black dots in Figure \ref{fig:auto_exp1_distr_1_3} demonstrate the distribution of the raw data. As shown in the figure, the discretization edges obtained by the optimal Bayesian approach and the resulting marginalized probability match the raw data well.

\subsubsection{Discretization while Learning Structure}
\label{subsubsec:auto_exp2}

If the network structure is not known in advance, it should be learned along with the discretization process. Figure \ref{fig:auto_graph_2} show a learned discrete-valued Bayesian network and the corresponding numbers of intervals after discretization for each continuous variable. This result is obtained by running Algorithm \ref{alg:structure_learn} fifty times (without the approximation) and choosing the one with the highest K2 score.

Figure \ref{fig:auto_exp2_distr_1_3} shows the discretization edges on variable $A$ and $C$ in Figure \ref{fig:auto_graph_2} along with the raw data. Again, the black dots are raw data points. The colors of discretized areas are the corresponding maginalized probability. Although the numbers of discretization edges of $A$ and $C$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:auto_exp2_distr_1_3} are less than Figure \ref{fig:auto_exp2_distr_1_3}, they still have a good capture of raw data distribution. This indicates that although the discretization result of the optimal Bayesian approach might vary according to the network structure, it still preserves the quality of discretization.

\subsection{Dataset 2: Wine}
\label{subsec:wine}

In this subsection, another two experiments are conducted on the Wine dataset from the Irvine repository \citep{Lichman_2013}. This dataset has 178 instances and 14 variables. Only variable $A$ is discrete-valued with cardinality number \num{3}. Again, in the first experiment, the network structure is given in advance. In the second experiment, the network structure is not provided in advance.

\subsubsection{Discretization with fixed Structure}
\label{subsubsec:wine_exp1}

The Bayesian network in Figure \ref{fig:wine_graph_1} is obtained by equal-width discretizing each continuous variable into 3 intervals and running K2 a thousand times. Table \ref{table:wine_disc_table_1} shows a comparison between the optimal Bayesian approach and the MDL principle discretization method.
The discretization result obtained by the optimal Bayesian approach is better than the MDL discretization method in terms of likelihood. The heuristic method discretizes variable $G$, $H$ and $J$ into one less interval than the optimal Bayesian approach, and has one more number of intervals on variable $M$.
Although it returns different numbers of intervals and different positions of discretization edges with the optimal Bayesian approach, it still has a good discretization result in terms of likelihood. Furthermore, if running time is the main concern, the heuristic method can be considered a better approach in this case.

Notice that there are some discretization edges appearing in all three discretization methods, such as \num{1.42} and \num{2.35} on variable $C$ and \num{0.785} on variable $L$. This indicates that MDL indeed can find some important discretization edges, but it is not sensitive enough to find more edges.

  \caption{Discretization results of Wine dataset based on the network in Fig. \ref{fig:wine_graph_1} by the three different methods. The first thirteen rows are discretization edges on each continuos variable. The fourteenth row is the log-likelihood of the dataset based on the discretization results. The optimal Bayesian approach has the best discretization result in terms of likelihood. The heuristic method obtains a result nearly as good as the Bayesian approach. The MDL method discretizes more than half of continuous variables but still does not discretize enough intervals. Some discretization edges appear in the results of all three methods, and indicate that they are the most determinant edges.}
  \scalebox{1.0}{
  \input{table_wine_1.tex}
  }
  \label{table:wine_disc_table_1}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:wine_exp1_distr} compares the discretization results by the optimal Bayesian approach and the MDL method. The discretization edges \num{17.9} on $E$ and \num{34.6} on $K$ appear in both plots. This indicates that they are more necessary than other discretization edges on $E$ and $K$. On the other hand, the edge \num{23.25} on $E$ is also meaningful. For instance, after having an extra edge at \num{23.25}, the area from $E = 17.9$ to $30$ is divided two rectangles such that the one from $E=17.9$ to $23.25$ has relatively higher probability than $E=23.25$ to $30$. The MDL method does not capture this edge due to its low sensitivity toward distribution. For more discussion about the sensitivity, see Section \ref{subsec:discuss_exp}.

\subsubsection{Discretization while Learning Structure}
\label{subsubsec:wine_exp2}

Figure \ref{fig:wine_graph_2} is the learned discrete-valued Bayesian network from the Wine dataset, and it is obtained by running Algorithm \ref{alg:structure_learn} fifty times. The integer numbers next to variables are cardinality numbers of variables. By comparing Figure \ref{fig:wine_graph_2} with \ref{fig:wine_graph_1}, it shows that the the Bayesian network obtained by Algorithm \ref{alg:structure_learn} has more edges than the network obtained by prediscretization and the K2 algorithm. This is sensible, since when a network is learned along with discretization, variables have more freedom, by adjusting discretization edges, to construct the correlations with other variables and thus have more edges in the network.

Figure \ref{fig:wine_exp2_distr} shows the discretization result on variable $E$ and $K$. The discretization edge at \num{17.9} on variable $E$ also appers in Figure \ref{fig:wine_exp1_distr}. This indicates that some discretization edges are robust against the network structure. Furthermore, in Figure \ref{fig:wine_exp2_distr}, the discretization edge at \num{23.5} on $E$ is lost. This is due to the number of parents of $E$ in Figure \ref{fig:wine_graph_2} is twice as in \ref{fig:wine_graph_1}. Usually, if a variable has more parents, then less number of intervals after discretization it has, since the information from parents are adulterated together.

\subsection{Data 3: Housing}
\label{subsec:housing}

In this subsection, another two experiments are conducted on the Housing dataset from the Irvine repository \citep{Lichman_2013}. This dataset has 506 instances and 14 variables. Only variables $D$ and $I$ are discrete-valued with cardinality numbers 2 and 9, respectively. Again, in the first experiment, the network structure is given in advance. In the second experiment, the network structure is not provided in advance.

\subsubsection{Discretization with Fixed Structure}
\label{subsubsec:housing_exp1}

The Bayesian network structure in Figure \ref{fig:housing_graph_1} is obtained by prediscretizing each continuous variable into five uniform-width intervals, then running the K2 algorithm one thousands time and choosing the network with the highest K2 score. Table \ref{table:housing_disc_table_1} shows the numbers of intervals after discretization on each continuous variables and also the log-likelihood of the dataset based on the discretization results. MDL method again does not discretize most variables. The heuristic method discretizes variables into too many intervals due to repeated values in the dataset, as we will see in later discussion. The optimal Bayesian approach has a good control of number of intervals. These numbers of intervals returned by the three methods illustrate that the heuristic method is over sensitive and the MDL method is less sensitive. The properties of sensitivity of the three algorithms will be discussed in Section \ref{subsec:discuss_exp}. On the other hand, although the heuristic method leads to high number of intervals, its corresponding log-likelihood on the dataset is not significantly better than the optimal Bayesian approach. This shows that the optimal Bayesian approach captures the important discretization edges.

The heuristic method is over sensitive and discretizes some variables into too many intervals. The MDL method is less sensitive and discretizes most variables by only one interval. The optimal Bayesian approach has a good control on number of intervals. \tim{Fig. vs. Figure}}

\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:housing_exp1_distr_3_5} and Figure~\ref{fig:housing_exp1_distr_8_5} show the discretization result of the optimal Bayesian approach on the network in Figure~\ref{fig:housing_graph_1}.
In Figure~\ref{fig:housing_exp1_distr_3_5}, the scatter points, which stands for the raw data, has been jittered, since there are many repeated values in the raw data on the variable pair $C$ and $E$. These repeating values cause the high number of intervals for both $C$ and $E$, because in some sense, each repeated-value point form a single discretized area. On the other hand, there is no such over repeated values of the raw data on variable $H$. Thus, the numbers of intervals after discretization for variable $H$ remains normal, as what we have seen in previous datasets.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Discretization while Learning Structure}
\label{subsubsec:housing_exp2}

Figure~\ref{fig:housing_graph_2} is the learned discrete-valued Bayesian network from the Housing dataset by running Algorithm~\ref{alg:structure_learn} fifty times.
In both Figure~\ref{fig:housing_graph_1} and Figure~\ref{fig:housing_graph_2}, the variable $D$ is not connected to any other variable.
Continuous variables $C$, $E$, $J$ and $K$, which are all in a Markov blanket, have high cardinality numbers after discretization.
This is reasonable, since when discretizing one variable, the expected cardinality is close to highest cardinality number in the Markov blanket.
This will lead to a group of variables that are close to each other and all have high cardinalities.

Figure~\ref{fig:housing_exp2_distr_3_5} and Figure~\ref{fig:housing_exp2_distr_8_5} show the discretization result on variables of the network in Figure~\ref{fig:housing_graph_2}.
Again, variable $C$ and $E$ have many discretization edges due to the repeated values.
Although the number of intervals after discretization on $H$ is not large, it captures the distribution of the raw data along with the discretization edges on $E$.

\subsection{Discussions}

    % \end{tabular}
  \caption{A simple Bayesian network that is used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the three methods}
  \label{fig:exp_discuss}
\end{figure}

To quantatively discuss the sensitivity of the three methods, consider the Bayesian network in Figure \ref{fig:exp_discuss}, where $X$ is continuous-valued and $P_1$ and $P_2$ is discrete-valued. Let $\Pi_X = \{  P_1, P_2 \}$. Assume $D_X = \{1.0,2.0,3.0, \ldots N \}$. Therefore, the corresponding objective functions to discretize $X$ in the three methods are:
{\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Obj}_{\text{MDL}} & = \overbrace{Z_1 \cdot k + \log(k) + \log {{N +k - 1}\choose{k -1}} }^{\text{Penalty Term}}+   \overbrace{\log(N) \cdot I(X^*, \Pi_X)}^{\text{Disc. Edge Positions Term}} \\
\text{Obj}_{\text{Bayesian}} &= \overbrace{Z_2 \cdot k + \log {{n_i + J_P - 1}\choose{J_P -1}}}^{\text{Penalty Term}} + \overbrace{\sum^k_{i=1} \log \left(   {{n_i !}\over{n^{(P)}_{i,1}! n^{(P)}_{i,2}! \cdots n^{(P)}_{i,J_P}!    }} \right) }^{\text{Disc. Edge Positions Term}}\\
\text{Obj}_{\text{Heuristic}} &= \overbrace{Z_2 \cdot k + \log {{n_i + J_{P_1} - 1}\choose{J_{P_1} -1}} + \log {{n_i + J_{P_2} - 1}\choose{J_{P_2} -1}} }^{\text{Penalty Term}}+\\
& \overbrace{\sum^k_{i=1}  \left[ \log \left(   {{n_i !}\over{n^{(P_1)}_{i,1}! n^{(P_1)}_{i,2}! \cdots n^{(P_1)}_{i,J_{P_1}}    }} \right)  + \log \left(   {{n_i !}\over{n^{(P_2)}_{i,1}! n^{(P_2)}_{i,2} \cdots n^{(P_2)}_{i,J_{P_2}} }} \right) \right]}^{\text{Disc. Edge Positions Term}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{small}}
, where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are two constants, $k$ is the number of intervals after discretization, $X^*$ is the discretized version of $X$, and $I(X^*, \Pi_X)$ is the mutual information between $X^*$ and its parent variables. Note that the third term in $\text{Obj}_{\text{MDL}}$ is approximated by $H(p)$ as in Equation \ref{eqn:MDL} in the original paper \citep{Friedman_1996}. 

The sensitivities toward the value distribution in $D_{\Pi_X}$ are determined by the `` Disc. Edge Positions Term" in the three objective functions. Since the penaltis of the numbers of intervals after discretization in the three objective functions take the similar form, if the `` Disc. Edge Positions Term" varies more severely due to different positions of discretization edges, then the corresponding method is more sensitive. The `` Disc. Edge Positions Term" in $\text{Obj}_{\text{MDL}}$, which is made out of the mutual information, varies less severely than the terms in $\text{Obj}_{\text{Bayesian}}$ and $\text{Obj}_{\text{Heuristic}}$, since it senses the distribution in $D_{\Pi_X}$ by empirical probability distributions, instead of the factorial terms such in $\text{Obj}_{\text{Bayesian}}$ and $\text{Obj}_{\text{Heuristic}}$. Furthermore, the `` Disc. Edge Positions Term" in $\text{Obj}_{\text{Heuristic}}$ varies more aggressively than the term in $\text{Obj}_{\text{Bayesian}}$. Therefore, the MDL method is less sensitive and the heuristic is over sensitive toward the value distributions in other variables. The effect of sensitivity can be shown as the numbers of intervals after discretization in the previous experiment.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, a new method for discretizating continuous varibles in Bayesian networks has been proposed. It is compatible with the K2 structure learning, i.e., it can discretize continuous variables along with the edge-adding process of the K2. Therefore, a discrete-valued Bayesian network can be learned from mix data.

Experiments on three real-world dataset show that the new method returns to a better discretization result than previous research in terms of likelihood. The discretization edges and the resulting marginal probabilities of discretized regions returned by the new method can match the row data well.

This work can extend the usage of Bayesian networks in science and engineering, especially for the fields that require discrete-valued variables but the learning data is mixed and numerical. In the future, we plan to generalize the work to the datast that has high dimensional variables, for example, 3 dimensional positions of drones, which makes the sorting in Equation \ref{eq:p_M} fails.
